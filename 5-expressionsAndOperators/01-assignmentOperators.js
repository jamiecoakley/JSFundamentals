// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

//Assignment operator
let x = 20;

//additional assignment operator
x += 1; //x = x + 1
console.log(x); //21

//subtraction assignment operator
x -= 1; //x = x - 1
console.log(x); //20

//multiplication assignment operator
x *= 2; //x = x * 2
console.log(x); //40

//division assignment operator
x =/ 4; //x = x / 4
console.log(x); //10

//remainder (modulus) assignment operator
x %= 2; //x = x % 2 (x mod 2) 10/2 = 5 with a remainder of 0 -> 0
console.log(x); //0

//modulus operator
console.log(5%3); //2       5/3 ->1 2/3 -> 2
console.log(25%7); //4      25/7 -> 3 4/7 -> 4

//exponential assignment operator
x **= 2;
console.log(x); //0

let y = 7;
y **= 3;
console.log(y) //343
